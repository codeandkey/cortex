## cortex

This is my first implementation of a basic chess engine. It supports all types of moves except castling.
As cortex was very experimental it does not implement UCI and is cumbersome to use. It uses a very slow
searching function and does not take advantage of optimization methods such as bitboards and multithreading.
It is being replaced with the UCI-compliant and much improved [neocortex](https://github.com/codeandkey/neocortex/).
