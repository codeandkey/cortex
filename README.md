## cortex

This was my first implementation of a basic chess engine. It supports all types of moves except castling.
As cortex was very experimental it did not implement UCI and was cumbersome to use. It uses a very slow
searching function and does not take advantage of optimization methods such as bitboards and multithreading.
It is being replaced with the UCI-compliant and much improved [neocortex](https://github.com/codeandkey/neocortex/).
